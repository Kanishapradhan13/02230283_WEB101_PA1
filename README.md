In this project i have made a pokedex in an attempt to replicate the original pokedex.

So basically what this website does is:
Display pokemon information : fetch the pokemon information such as name, height, weight, and description from pokeAPI. In my code i have made the limit of fetching 1000 pokemons only
but you can search for any pokemons and it will give you the information. 

Search function: the webpage has a functionality of entering the name in the search input field and pressing the search button to fetch and display the information about that specific pokemon.

Add to favourites: Users can click the "Add to Favorites" button on any Pokémon card to add it to their list of favorite Pokémon. The favorites count is stored locally using the browser's localStorage API.

View Favorites: The header contains a link to view the user's list of favorite Pokémon. Clicking on this link navigates the user to another page where they can see their favorite Pokémon. You can even remove the pokemons from the favourites

Hover Effects: Pokémon cards have a hover effect applied to them. When a user hovers over a card, it moves up slightly and the shadow intensity increases.

Smooth Card Entry Animation: Pokémon cards are animated to fade in and move slightly upwards when they appear on the screen

View Details: the pokemon card contains the "Know more" button which will navigate you to a new page with the details of that specific pokemon.
